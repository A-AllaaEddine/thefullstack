            By using the Site, you agree that we can use the cookies described
            in this Cookie Policy. You can stop cookies by changing the settings

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">1. What are cookies?</h3>
          <p>
            Cookies are text files, containing small amounts of information,
            which are downloaded to your browsing device (such as a computer or
            smartphone) when you visit a website. Cookies can be recognized by
            the website that downloaded them — or other websites that use the
            same cookies. This helps websites know if the browsing device has
            visited them before.
          </p>

            2. What are cookies used for?
          </h3>
          <p>
            Cookies do lots of different jobs, like helping us understand how
            the Site is being used, letting you navigate between pages
            efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improving
            your browsing experience. Cookies can also help ensure marketing you

            one of six categories: Strictly Necessary, Performance,
            Functionality, Tailored Content and Targeting. In order to provide

            4. Strictly necessary cookies
          </h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are essential, as they enable you to move around the
            Site and use its features, such as accessing secure areas. Without
            these cookies, some services you have asked for such as payment
            submission can&apos;t be provided.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">5. Performance cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies collect information about how you use the Site, for
            example which pages you go to most often and if you get error
            messages from certain pages. These cookies don&apos;t gather
            information that identifies you. All information these cookies
            collect is anonymous and is only used to improve how the Site works.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">6. Functionality cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies allow the Site to remember choices you make (such as
            your user name, language or the region you&apos;re in). For example,
            the Site may use functionality cookies to remember your language
            preference. These cookies can also be used to remember changes
            you&apos;ve made to text size, font, and other parts of pages that
            you can customize. They may also be used to provide services
            you&apos;ve asked for such as watching a video or commenting on a
            blog. The information these cookies collect may be anonymous and
            they cannot track your browsing activity on other websites.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">7. Tailored content cookies</h3>
          <p>
            Tailored content cookies help the Site provide enhanced features and
            display content in a way that is relevant to you. These cookies help
            the Site determine what information to show you based on how you
            have used the Site previously. These cookies do not track your
            browsing activity on other websites.
          </p>

          <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">8. Targeting cookies</h3>
          <p>
            These cookies are used to deliver advertisements that are more
            relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit the
            number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the
            effectiveness of an advertising campaign. They remember that you
            have visited a website and this information may be shared with other
            organizations such as advertisers. This means after you have been to
            the Site you may see some advertisements about our services
            elsewhere on the Internet.
          </p>

            9. How long will cookies stay on my browsing device?
          </h3>
          <p>
            The length of time a cookie will stay on your browsing device
            depends on whether it is a “persistent” or “session” cookie. Session
            cookies will only stay on your device until you stop browsing.
            Persistent cookies stay on your browsing device until they expire or
            are deleted.

            10. First and Third Party cookies
          </h3>
          <p>
            First party cookies are cookies that belong to us, while third party
            cookies are cookies that another party places on your browsing
            device through our Site. For example, Facebook will place a cookie
            on your browsing device if you click on the Facebook link when
            browsing the Site.
