    answer:
      'So glad you asked! One thing that many people forget is that a job posting is an advertisement, and they need to sell your vision, your culture, your team and the role. Typical job boards are boring and give little insight to the team, their culture and what the people on the team are like. This is why we stress the importance of Teams and put the team profile first before the job role listed. Its important for you and your team to find the right developer that wants to be part of your team, to be challenged, to learn and to grow. This is what retains people and gives people a purpose, and this is what makes the best teams give the best output and results - its a win all round.',
